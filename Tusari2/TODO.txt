* Using Scroller in multi-direction mode as an engine, assess the feasibility of creating Tusari 2 which would be a hack-n-slash with daggers and magic.


* Need art assets, reverse existing Tusari code or just rip from active Vice snapshots?
	Might need to write a one-off Tusari format to CharPad conversion tool to grab the maps. They will have lots of empty areas because the flip screen levels were sparse.
